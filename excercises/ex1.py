# Study drills:
# 1. Make your script print another line.
print "\nDrill 1:\n"
print "Here's another line, but I don't know if this is what you meant"

# 2. Make your script print only one of the lines.
print "\nDrill 2:\n"
# print "Hello World"
# print "Hello again"
print "I liked typing this"
# print "This is fun."
# print "Yay! Printing."
# print "I'd much rather you 'not'."
# print 'I "said" do not touch this.'

# Again, not sure if the above is what he meant.

# 3. Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what
# this character does.
print "\nDrill 3:\n"
print "The octothorpe comments out the line, so it won't print."
